# _Croft Games_ entry for the [2024 GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)

This repository has been created ahead of time as a learning and testing environment; it'll be easier to just carry on using this repo rather than creating a new one for the actual Jam.

The CI config and basic project setup probably will be used for the actual event, 
but no design, assets, or game code committed before the event starts will be used in the final game unless it is generic enough to fall within the rules.
